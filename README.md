# The-Gaming-Room
The Gaming Room was a flexible application game producer with previous success who had a riddle rivalry game on the Android platform. The goal was to make this game available across all platforms and devices.

I wrote a very detailed segment outlooking the important areas for the client to consider when making this application. Some of these suggestions included which Operating framework was most efficient and another suggestion was which memory would make the most sense. I suggested a hybrid approach where the game would be stored on the cloud and the user's information would be stored on a local storage device. The reason for this is that updates would be easier to push on a cloud based drive and user's personal information would be more secure on a local storage.

I found the UML outline very helpful in understanding the process motions of this application. I am a visual person so actually seeing the steps was very insightful.

I would say imporving the diagram going over each Client side and Server side applications of each operating system would be the first part of this project that I would revise. I thought I eventually did okay, but not using or knowing all the operating systems server functions and practicality was pretty hard. Eventually I did some research and found what each operating systems provided on the server end and how it could impact what our client was looking for.

The main focus was speed and convenience. The client wanted things done in a timely matter but also in a convenient one. No one likes browsing a slow website or playing a game that takes forever to load and no one likesa clunky menu or website either. These were taken into consideration for the Client.

Starting off slow and understanding the full task at hand. Finding misatakes and correcting them at the earliest convenience. Having a flexible mindset when entering also helps to have a more agile way of thinking. Focusing on the main requirements first and then building from there helps as well. The most important thing I would say is to take time to find all the requirements then work at making sure each one is fulfilled within the scope of the Clients demands.
